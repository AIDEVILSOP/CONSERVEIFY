                    <p>The air conditioner and heater are the biggest energy users in most homes, and these appliances have to work even harder with dirty air filters. Write the date of installation on the filter to help you remember when it needs to be replaced.

                    <p>Even when not in use, household electronics still draw power from outlets. This phenomenon is called “phantom load”. Energy-saving smart power strips, which shut down appliances that have gone into standby mode, help you cut down on phantom-load costs, potentially resulting in money and energy savings.                    </p>

                    <p>You’re paying for warm air in the winter and cool air in the summer — don’t let that money escape! Check your windows and doors for cracks and gaps, and seal them up with new weather stripping or caulk.

                    <p>Keep your house a little hotter in the summer and a little cooler in the winter. Opt for wearing lighter clothes in the summer and wearing a few extra layers in the winter in exchange for those few degrees’ change in temperature. A good rule of thumb is to set the thermostat to 68 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter and to 78 in the summer.

                    <img src="IMAGES/11 cw.png">
                    <p> On average, appliances are responsible for roughly 13% of total household energy use. When purchasing an appliance, you should pay attention to two numbers: the initial purchase price and the annual operating cost. Although energy efficient appliances might have higher upfront purchase prices, their operating costs are often 9-25% lower than conventional models.

                    <h1>Use natural light</h1>
                    <img src="images/12 cw.png">
                    <p>Lighting accounts for a significant amount of energy costs and using light from the sun is an intuitive way to reduce your energy consumption. If you can, it is better to have north and south-facing windows instead of east and west. This allows for more glancing light that produces heat and limits harsh light in the winter. While east and west-facing windows allow for more direct sunlight, they aren't as effective at letting heat in.</p>                </div>
